"Based on the provided information and instructions, here are some test scenarios for the `getId()` method of the `Product` class:

```
Scenario 1: Retrieve ID of a Product with a Valid ID

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: Verify that the getId() method returns the correct ID value for a product that has been assigned an ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance and set its ID using the setId() method.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the one that was set.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getId() method correctly retrieves the ID value that was assigned to the product. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and proper identification of products in the system.

Scenario 2: Retrieve ID of a Newly Created Product

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsNullForNewProduct
  Description: Check if the getId() method returns null for a newly created Product instance that hasn't been assigned an ID yet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting an ID.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that newly created products don't have an automatically assigned ID, which is important for understanding the product lifecycle and ensuring proper ID management.

Scenario 3: Retrieve ID After Setting to Zero

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsZeroAfterSettingToZero
  Description: Verify that the getId() method returns zero when the ID is explicitly set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its ID to 0L using the setId() method.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID is 0L.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getId() with a zero ID, which might be an edge case in some systems. It ensures consistent handling of zero as a valid ID value.

Scenario 4: Retrieve ID After Changing Its Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsUpdatedValue
  Description: Ensure that the getId() method returns the most recent ID value after it has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance, set an initial ID, then change it to a different value.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID matches the most recently set value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getId() method always returns the most up-to-date ID value, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially in scenarios where product IDs might be updated.

Scenario 5: Retrieve ID of Maximum Possible Long Value

Details:
  TestName: getIdReturnsMaxLongValue
  Description: Verify that the getId() method correctly handles and returns the maximum possible Long value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set its ID to Long.MAX_VALUE using the setId() method.
  Act: Call the getId() method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned ID is equal to Long.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior of getId() with the maximum possible Long value, ensuring that the method can handle extreme values without overflow or data loss. It's important for robustness and edge case handling in the system.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `getId()` method, including normal usage, edge cases, and potential error conditions, while adhering to the provided constraints and using only the methods and fields explicitly mentioned in the instructions.
