"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getId() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing potentially sensitive information in URLs.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET requests. Use HTTP POST requests instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: Exposing the internal id of a database record can potentially lead to privacy violation and other security risks.
Solution: Consider using UUIDs or other forms of public ids for exposing record identifiers to the outside world.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The getId() method is public, and can be accessed from anywhere, potentially revealing sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure that only necessary methods are public. If this method is not required to be accessed outside the class, consider making it private or protected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate retrieval of product ID
Details:
    TestName: getIdReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method correctly retrieves the product ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object and set a known ID using setId.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the known ID that was set.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retrieves the product ID. This is important as it ensures the persistence layer is correctly retrieving product IDs, which is crucial for product management operations.

Scenario 2: Validate null handling of getId method
Details:
    TestName: getIdHandlesNull
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method handles null ID values gracefully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object without setting an ID.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly handles null ID values. This is important as it ensures the application can correctly handle products that haven't been persisted yet, preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Validate getId with multiple products
Details:
    TestName: getIdReturnsCorrectValueWithMultipleProducts
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method correctly retrieves the ID for multiple Product objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate multiple Product objects, each with a unique ID.
    Act: Call the getId method on each Product object.
    Assert: Assert that each returned ID matches the known ID for the corresponding Product.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retrieves the ID for each product. This is important to ensure the correct identification of products when multiple products are being managed.

Scenario 4: Validate getId after changing product ID
Details:
    TestName: getIdReflectsIdChange
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getId method correctly retrieves the updated product ID after it has been changed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a Product object and set an ID. Then, change the ID to a different value.
    Act: Call the getId method on the Product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the updated ID.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getId method correctly reflects changes to the product ID. This is important to ensure the application correctly tracks changes to product IDs, which may occur during update operations.
