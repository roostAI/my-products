"### Scenario 1: Validate getId with Unset ID

Details:
  TestName: validateUnsetProductId
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getId method when the ID has not been set. This is crucial to ensure the method handles uninitialized ID values gracefully.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class without setting an ID.
  Act: Retrieve the ID using the getId method.
  Assert: The expected result is null since the ID was never set.

Validation:
  The assertion is used to verify that getId returns null for a newly created Product instance, as the ID is not explicitly set. The significance of this test lies in verifying the default state of a new Product object, pertinent in scenarios where product details are progressively updated after instantiation.

### Scenario 2: Validate getId with Explicitly Set ID

Details:
  TestName: validateExplicitSetProductId
  Description: This test verifies that the getId method correctly returns the ID that was explicitly set using the setId method. It's important to confirm the proper state transition from unset to set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the Product class and set the ID to a known value (e.g., 12345L).
  Act: Retrieve the ID using the getId method.
  Assert: The expected result is 12345L, identical to the value set in the Arrange step.

Validation:
  The assertion confirms whether getId accurately retrieves a previously set value. This test is vital for validating the consistency and reliability of ID management in the Product class, which is fundamental for identifying and manipulating product data.

### Scenario 3: Validate getId Behavior on ID Reassignment

Details:
  TestName: validateProductIdReassignment
  Description: Evaluates the getId method's response to changing the product ID multiple times, ensuring that the method consistently returns the latest assigned value.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product instance, set ID initially to 12345L, then reset it to 67890L.
  Act: Call getId to fetch the current ID.
  Assert: The expected result should be 67890L, reflecting the most recent assignment.

Validation:
  The assertion checks the capability of the Product class to update and retrieve the latest ID value accurately. This scenario is crucial for applications that may involve updating product identifiers due to business rules or operational requirements. It also checks for state integrity in the Product object over multiple updates.

These scenarios thoroughly examine the functionalities of the getId method, focusing on both initialized and uninitialized states, as well as the system's behavior under conditions of state change, ensuring comprehensive coverage and robustness in handling real-world use-cases.
