"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getName() method might be used in HTTP GET requests, exposing sensitive information in URLs, logs, browser history, etc.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive data in GET request. Use HTTP POST instead. Also, use HTTPS instead of HTTP to protect data in transit.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getName() method could be a leftover from debugging, which can expose sensitive information or system details.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is removed from production code. Implement a code review process to catch such issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the getName() method is used to retrieve sensitive user information, it can lead to privacy violations if not handled properly.
Solution: Ensure that personal data is properly protected, both in storage and in transit. Apply the principle of least privilege.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check the returned product name is correct

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsCorrectName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method correctly returns the product name that was previously set using the setName method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object and set a known name using the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from getName against the expected name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getName method correctly returns the product name that was set. The expected result is the known name that was set using setName. This test is significant as it ensures that the product name can be correctly retrieved, which is crucial for displaying product information to users.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getName returns null when no name is set

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameReturnsNullWhenNameNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getName method returns null when no name has been set for the product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object without setting a name.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the result from getName is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getName returns null when no name has been set for the product. The expected result is null. This test is important as it checks that the method behaves as expected when no name has been set, which can occur when a new product is created without a name.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getName handles empty names correctly

Details:
  TestName: testGetNameHandlesEmptyNames
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getName method returns an empty string when the product's name is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Product object and set the name as an empty string using the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the getName method on the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the result from getName is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getName returns an empty string when the product's name is set to an empty string. The expected result is an empty string. This test is important as it checks that the method can handle empty names, which can occur in scenarios where a product's name is removed.
