}
"Based on the provided information and instructions, here are several test scenarios for the `deleteProduct` method in the `ProductController` class:

Scenario 1: Successfully Delete an Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: Verify that the method successfully deletes an existing product and returns a 200 OK response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository with an existing product.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the ID of the existing product.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is 200 OK and the product is deleted from the repository.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the deleteProduct method correctly handles the deletion of an existing product. It verifies that the method interacts properly with the repository and returns the expected HTTP status code.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete a Non-existent Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: Verify that the method returns a 404 Not Found response when attempting to delete a product that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository that returns an empty Optional for findById.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with an ID that doesn't exist in the repository.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is 404 Not Found.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the deleteProduct method correctly handles attempts to delete non-existent products. It verifies that the method returns the appropriate HTTP status code when the product is not found in the repository.

Scenario 3: Handle Repository Exception During Deletion

Details:
  TestName: handleRepositoryExceptionDuringDeletion
  Description: Verify that the method handles exceptions thrown by the repository during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository that throws an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the method catches the exception and returns an appropriate error response.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the deleteProduct method gracefully handles unexpected exceptions from the repository. It verifies that the method doesn't crash and returns an appropriate error response to the client.

Scenario 4: Verify Repository Interaction

Details:
  TestName: verifyRepositoryInteraction
  Description: Ensure that the method correctly interacts with the ProductRepository, calling findById and delete methods.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository and configure it to expect specific method calls.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that findById and delete methods of the repository were called with the correct parameters.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the deleteProduct method correctly uses the ProductRepository. It ensures that the method follows the expected workflow of finding the product and then deleting it.

Scenario 5: Delete Product with Associated Data

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithAssociatedData
  Description: Verify that the method successfully deletes a product that has associated data in other tables.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository with a product that has associated data.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the ID of this product.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is 200 OK and that all associated data is properly handled.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the deleteProduct method correctly handles the deletion of products with complex relationships. It verifies that the deletion doesn't leave orphaned data or violate referential integrity.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the deleteProduct method, including successful deletion, handling of non-existent products, error handling, repository interactions, and deletion of products with associated data. They aim to ensure the robustness and correctness of the method under different conditions.
