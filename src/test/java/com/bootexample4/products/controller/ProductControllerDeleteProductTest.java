@When("the client sends a DELETE request to {string}")
public void the_client_sends_a_delete_request_to(String string) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions

}
"Based on the provided information, here are several test scenarios for the `deleteProduct` method in the `ProductController` class:

Scenario 1: Successfully Delete an Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: Verify that the method successfully deletes an existing product and returns an OK response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository with an existing product.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the ID of the existing product.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity.ok() is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures that when a valid product ID is provided, the product is deleted from the repository and the API returns a successful response. It's crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing correct feedback to the client.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Delete a Non-existent Product

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistentProduct
  Description: Verify that the method returns a not found response when trying to delete a product that doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository with no matching product for the given ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a non-existent product ID.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity.notFound().build() is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the API handles attempts to delete non-existent products gracefully, returning an appropriate not found response. It's important for error handling and preventing unintended side effects.

Scenario 3: Handle Exception During Product Deletion

Details:
  TestName: handleExceptionDuringDeletion
  Description: Verify that the method handles exceptions thrown during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository that throws an exception when delete is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a valid product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate error response is returned (e.g., ResponseEntity.status(500).build()).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the API can handle unexpected errors during the deletion process, providing a robust error handling mechanism. It's crucial for maintaining system stability and providing meaningful feedback in case of internal errors.

Scenario 4: Verify Repository Interaction

Details:
  TestName: verifyRepositoryInteraction
  Description: Ensure that the productRepository's findById and delete methods are called with the correct parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock ProductRepository with an existing product.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the ID of the existing product.
  Assert: Verify that productRepository.findById() was called with the correct ID and productRepository.delete() was called with the correct product.
Validation:
  This test verifies the correct interaction between the controller and the repository, ensuring that the right methods are called with the appropriate parameters. It's important for maintaining the integrity of the data access layer.

Scenario 5: Delete Product with Null ID

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithNullId
  Description: Verify the behavior of the method when called with a null ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with a null ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate error response is returned (e.g., ResponseEntity.badRequest().build()).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the API properly handles invalid input, specifically a null ID. It's important for input validation and preventing potential null pointer exceptions.

These scenarios cover the main functionality of the deleteProduct method, including successful deletion, handling of non-existent products, error handling, repository interaction, and input validation. They aim to ensure the robustness and correctness of the delete operation in various situations.
