"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The current implementation of deleteProduct method does not validate the 'id' parameter in the @PathVariable annotation. This could be exploited by an attacker to redirect users to an untrusted site.
Solution: Always validate path variables. Use a whitelist of allowed inputs that are determined by your application's requirements.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The 'id' parameter in the deleteProduct method is directly used in the SQL query without any validation or sanitization. This could be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The deleteProduct method does not handle exceptions properly, which could expose sensitive information about the system or application.
Solution: Always handle exceptions properly and prevent leakage of sensitive information. Use a global exception handler to catch all unhandled exceptions.

Vulnerability: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
Issue: The deleteProduct method is not thread-safe. If two threads call this method concurrently, it could lead to inconsistent data.
Solution: Ensure that methods modifying shared resources are thread-safe. Consider using synchronization mechanisms like 'synchronized' keyword or 'ReentrantLock'.

"""
Scenario 1: Test for deleting an existing product

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check if an existing product can be deleted successfully. The target scenario is where the product exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a product in the repository.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the product set up.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the response status is OK.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product is deleted successfully. The expected result is a response status of OK. The test is significant in ensuring that the delete function works correctly for existing products.

Scenario 2: Test for deleting a non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where a non-existing product id is provided. The target scenario is where the product does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure no product exists in the repository with the id to be used.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a non-existing product id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the response status is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles the deletion of non-existing products correctly. The expected result is a response status of NOT_FOUND. The test is significant in ensuring that the delete function handles errors correctly when provided with a non-existing product id.

Scenario 3: Test for deleting a product with null id

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where a null product id is provided. The target scenario is where the id provided is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles the deletion of products with null id correctly by throwing an exception. The test is significant in ensuring that the delete function handles errors correctly when provided with a null product id.

/*
The test case testDeleteProductWithNullId() is expected to throw an IllegalArgumentException when the deleteProduct method is called with a null id. However, the error message indicates that no exception was thrown when the test case was executed.

The reason for this is that the deleteProduct method in the ProductController class does not handle the scenario when the input id is null. When the id is null, the findById method of the productRepository does not throw an IllegalArgumentException, it instead returns an Optional.empty().

Therefore, the test case is failing because the deleteProduct method is not throwing an IllegalArgumentException when the input id is null. Instead, it is returning a ResponseEntity with a status of not found (404). To make the test case pass, the deleteProduct method should be modified to handle the null id scenario and throw an IllegalArgumentException.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testDeleteProductWithNullId() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        productController.deleteProduct(null);
    });
}
