"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: In the current code, the ID from the URL is directly used to fetch the product. While this doesn't directly lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability, it's a pattern that can lead to such issues if a developer isn't careful. If any redirection based on the ID or any other user input is added in the future, it could be exploited to redirect users to malicious sites.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input. Be especially careful with any user input that is used in a URL or for redirection. If possible, use a list of allowed values instead of directly using user input in a URL or for redirection.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If the product is not found, a 404 Not Found response is returned. While this is not directly an issue, if any more information is added to this error message in the future, it could expose sensitive information.
Solution: Always be careful with what information is included in error messages. Never include sensitive information or information that could help an attacker understand the system architecture in error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the method 'productRepository.findById(id)' is not implemented correctly, it could lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities. This would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code.
Solution: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when dealing with SQL. Never build SQL queries using string concatenation with user input.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for successful retrieval of a product by its ID
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdSuccess
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method getProductById is able to retrieve a product by its ID successfully when the product exists in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and save a product in the productRepository.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with the ID of the created product.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the correct product and the status code is OK.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method is able to retrieve the correct product when given a valid ID. This is important because it ensures that users can retrieve product information accurately.

Scenario 2: Test for failure when trying to retrieve a product by an ID that does not exist
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdFailure
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method getProductById when the provided ID does not correspond to any product in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the productRepository is empty or the chosen id does not correspond to any product.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with a non-existing product ID.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity's status code is NOT_FOUND.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case when the product ID does not exist in the repository. This is crucial for error handling and providing accurate feedback to the user.

Scenario 3: Test for behavior when a null ID is provided
Details:
  TestName: testGetProductByIdNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method getProductById when a null ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are testing with null.
  Act: Invoke the getProductById method with null as the ID.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method can handle null input and throw an appropriate exception. This is important for preventing unexpected errors during execution.

/*
The test `testGetProductByIdNullId` is expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown when the `getProductById` function is called with null as the argument. This exception would typically be thrown when a method is called with an argument that is illegal or inappropriate, such as a null where an object is required, or a value outside of its expected range.

However, according to the provided error log, no exception was thrown when the test was run. This means that the `getProductById` function is not throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` when it is given a null argument, as the test is expecting.

The reason for this could be that the `getProductById` function is not properly handling the case where the id argument is null. It might be ignoring the null value and just returning a `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()`, which does not throw an exception. Alternatively, it could be throwing a different type of exception that the test is not expecting, such as a `NullPointerException`.

In order to fix this issue, the `getProductById` function should be adjusted to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when it is called with a null argument. This would make it behave as expected according to the test, and would also improve its error handling in general, as it should not accept null as a valid argument.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetProductByIdNullId() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> productController.getProductById(null));
}
