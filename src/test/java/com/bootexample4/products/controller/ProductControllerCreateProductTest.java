"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
Issue: The controller method createProduct directly uses the product object received from the client. This means a malicious user could manipulate the request to add, modify, or remove attributes of the product object.
Solution: Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to strictly control what data can be received from the client. Validate all incoming data.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The code does not seem to validate the origin of the request, which could lead to redirect attacks where users are unknowingly redirected to a malicious site.
Solution: Always validate the origin of requests, especially if your application uses redirects. Make sure to only redirect to trusted and verified URLs.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method createProduct does not check if the user is authenticated or has the correct permissions to create a product. This could lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
Solution: Before performing critical functions, always check if the user is authenticated and has the correct permissions. Use an authentication and authorization framework like Spring Security.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Product Creation with Valid Input

Details:
    TestName: createProductWithValidInput.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the createProduct method when it is provided with a valid product object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new product object with valid attributes (name, description, price).
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the newly created product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned product object with the one created for the test.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the product returned by the createProduct method is the same as the one passed to it. This confirms that the product is correctly saved in the repository.

Scenario 2: Test Product Creation with Null Input

Details:
    TestName: createProductWithNullInput.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when it is provided with a null product object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the product object to null.
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the null product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the createProduct method throws an exception when provided with a null product object. This is important as it prevents null objects from being saved in the repository.

Scenario 3: Test Product Creation with Incomplete Input

Details:
    TestName: createProductWithIncompleteInput.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when it is provided with a product object that has incomplete attributes (e.g., missing name or price).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new product object with incomplete attributes (e.g., missing name or price).
    Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the incomplete product object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that an exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the createProduct method throws an exception when provided with an incomplete product object. This ensures that only complete and valid products are saved in the repository.
